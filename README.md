# Car-Pooling-Project-JavaFX-Scene-Builder-
Carpooling is one of the top solutions for go green initiative implemented by many a firm. Carpooling being a concept needs to be properly implemented so as to make it a success. To drive people into this scheme, a proper platform has to be provided along with incentives if necessary.  As we know pooling our vehicle with others will bring down the carbon levels and reduce fuel consumption, which will give our mother nature more time to re-grow.
This application provides the user with an option to register themselves as a vehicle owner or a passenger and participate in day-to-day pooling. The user selects his route and his boarding or starting point. Based on the vacancy appropriate passengers are added and pooled with the vehicle owner. A separate register is maintained to track the pooling activities of the user and appropriate incentives are provided. On the technical side, the application is solely developed in Java programming language using file I/O and basic features.
